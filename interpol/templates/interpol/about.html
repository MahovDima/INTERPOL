        <h2>What is INTERPOL?</h2>
        <p>Our full name is the International Criminal Police Organization and we are an inter-governmental organization. We have 195 member countries, and we help police in all of them to work together to make the world a safer place.</p>
        <p>To do this, we enable them to share and access data on crimes and criminals, and we offer a range of technical and operational support.</p>

        <h2>Connecting police</h2>
        <p>We connect all our countries via a communications system called <b>I-24/7</b>. Countries use this secure network to contact each other, and the General Secretariat. It also allows them to access our databases and services in real-time, from both central and remote locations.</p>
        <p>We also coordinate networks of police and experts in different crime areas, who come together through working groups and at conferences to share experiences and ideas.</p>

        <h2>A global platform</h2>
        <p>Today's crimes are increasingly international. It is crucial that there is coordination among all the different players in maintaining a global security architecture.</p>
        <p>Since INTERPOL is a global organization, it can provide this platform for cooperation; we enable police to work directly with their counterparts, even between countries which do not have diplomatic relations.</p>
        <p>We also provide a voice for police on the world stage, engaging with governments at the highest level to encourage this cooperation and use of our services.</p>
        <p>All our actions are politically neutral and taken within the limits of existing laws in different countries.</p>
